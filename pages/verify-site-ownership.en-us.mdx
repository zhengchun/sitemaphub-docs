# How to Verify Ownership of Your Site

When you add a new site to your account,see [How to add a new site](/add-new-site), you need to verify that you own the site by proving ownership. Currently we provide 2 methods to verify ownership of your site:

- DNS record (recommended): this method requires that you add a verification txt record to your domain's DNS settings.

- HTML file:  this method requires you to download the HTML verification file and upload it to your domain's root folder.

** 1. Log into your SitemapHub account. **

Go to https://sitemaphub.com/login and log into your SitemapHub platform account.

** 2. Then click and go to the “Site Verification” page on the left hand side. **

** 2. Add the TXT record to your domain host provider.**

- Sign in to your domain host account.
- Go to your domain’s DNS records. The page might be called something like “DNS Management”, “Name Server Management”, “Control Panel”, or "Advanced Settings".
- Select the option to add a new record. For the record type, select **TXT**.
- In the **Name/Host/Alias** field, enter @ or leave it blank.
